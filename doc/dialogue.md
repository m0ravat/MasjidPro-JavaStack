## Initial Dialogue
Product Owner: Greetings team! To start off with this project I recommend you 
all read the documentation by me and the Scrum Master, this highlights the 
relevant requirements expected. ALl tasks have been allocated on Jira. If anyone
has anything to say/notify us of before the project starts tomorrow please let us 
know here!

Scrum Master: Hey guys, as you know I am in charge of allocating tasks on Jira (which will be revamped by the end of today) as well as working with 
the QA Developer/Product Owner to ensure company standards are met. Your first point of contact would be me or QA depending on the 
query you have, for GitHub/documentation related issues contact QA and for anything team/task related reach out to me. Best of luck to you all, good day!


QA Developer: Hey team, as you know my job is to help the product owner put their 
wishes on the documentation for you guys so if anything is unclear don't hesitate to reach out to me. Since I am managing all GitHub activity
I have a few things to note:   
Please start the commit message by stating your role and name, also make sure to code in your relevant branch. If you believe the task has been finished adequately 
include that in the commit description so I can test it and see if it passes.   
Since some documentation is yet to be done I will review it all ASAP tomorrow, meanwhile I have a medical appointment today so I will be unreachable. Please go to the Scrum Master. I have allowed for relevant members to make commits without my approval, for the rest of you the idea of today is to get your environments sorted and plan what to do. 

Rest of team: greetings and eager to begin.
