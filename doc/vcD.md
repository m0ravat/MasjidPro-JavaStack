# Version Control & Deployment

## Version Control 
I will be using GitHub to keep track of respective changes. 
### Overview
I will create multiple repositories, one for the main backend hosted here as well as the desktop UI app, another for the mobile app, and another for the web app. This is to separate the main codebases and to ensure I don't have workplace configurations changing by switching between Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ. My aim is to have informative and succinct commit messages so I can keep up with my daily progress.
### Branching Strategy
I will create separate branches for major implementations and merge them to the main but keep them alive. This way it's easy to check overall commit history and see more specific commits by going on respective branches. 
### Pull Request (PR Workflow)
None since I'm working solo
### Merge Strategy
Merge to origin/main without bringing each branch's exclusive commits so it's not extremely long. 
### Tagging & Releases
Will use Github to create new versions (1.0, 1.1 etc) to show updates if in the future I decide to expand on this. 
## Deployment
Unknown as of yet but it will likely be local oriented since this isn't going to be used for commercial use (yet)
### Environement & Overview
Visual Studio Code for the web app, IntelliJ for Springboot, the desktop UI and Kotlin based mobile app. Might need extra environment for SwiftUI but unknown as of yet. 
### Environement Variables
TBC
