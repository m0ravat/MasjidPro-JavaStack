# Software Methodology

## 1. Introduction
This project follows the **Scrum** approach, which was chosen due to its suitability for **flexibility for teams and solo developers**. This methodology ensures that development remains **iterative and transparent**, aligning with the project's goals.

## 2. Development Lifecycle
The development process is divided into 5 events and 3 artifacts: 

### The 5 scrum events
- Sprint: A fixed length iteration (typically 1-4 weeks) where you work to deliver one potentially shippable product increment.
- Sprint planning: When everyone decides what work will be done and how it'll be achieved (includes moving items from product backlog to spring backlog)
- Daily Scrum: Daily meeting to look at progress and see if they need to adapt/change their plan for the next 24 hours. 
- Sprint review: At end of sprint inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog based off of feedback. 
- Spring retrospective: In between the sprint review/planning, see how you can improve efficiency for the next sprint. 

### The 3 artifacts
- Product backlog: Includes everything the team needs to achieve to deliver the final product. 
- Sprint backlog: What the team intends to achieve during the sprint.
- The Increment: The latest version of the product that conforms to the definition of done, it includes all product backlog items completed during the sprint and previous sprints. 

Each phase follows a structured workflow to maintain efficiency and consistency.

## 3. Project Management & Workflow
- **Task Tracking**: Issues and tasks are managed using **Jira**, with clear assignments and deadlines.
- **Collaboration**: Team members communicate via **N/A**, and conduct regular meetings such as **daily individual plans for myself**.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Create all items that need to be done in the backlog
  2. Plan all of my sprints and divide tasks
  3. Complete a sprint then review what's been done, update backlog/future plans
  4. Self evaluation in between each spring

I will also have a slideshow of images highlighting my process in this.
