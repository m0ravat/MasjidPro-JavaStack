# Code Structure

## Coding environment
I will use IntelliJ IDE, it provides support for Vue.js, Kotlin and SpringBoot which 
means I don't need to worry about environment changes. 

## Folder Structure
The .idea folder holds information crucial for IntelliJ IDE configurations, a doc folder 
for documentation. This is split into planning, analysis, design, testing and maintenance 
to cover the whole Software Development Lifecycle.  

I have a separate directory for my SpringBackend which is my core backend for APIs, I will
have a separate one for authentication to keep code modular and make it less congested.

I will also have a directory for my Vue.js app and possibly another one for Kotlin mobile TBC.
