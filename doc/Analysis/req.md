# Requirements

## User Requirements
These requirements were formed 14/08/2025 and as such may have evolved over time, many requirements may also be implied (parents can add absences for upcoming/previous so it's assumed teachers/headteacher can view that)
### Prospective Students/parents/anyone
View information on the website about the mosque's events/books/courses/subjects. 
Make an application for enrollment. 

### Students
View personal information and alter it once they reach a certain age, view grades/feedback assigned, view formal complaints/processes against them (suspension, detention etc), view lessons & timetable, view events in the mosque and those recommended to them. 
### Parents
View relevant child/teacher info, adjust personal/contact info for themselves and the student, view events, (potentially make payments for books/course) and add absences. 
### Teachers 
View personal information and updating it, view grades/feedback given to students and provide follow-up, make formal complaint/action to a student, view respective timetable, view contact info for students/respective parents. 

### Headteacher/admin(s)
Add new events, remove/archive existing ones, view contact information for teachers/parents/students, view formal complaints and filter, view grades and timetables for students/teachers. Adding new courses/subjects/timetables etc (mainly CRUD features).
Upon further evaluation some of these may be restricted to the headteacher/main admin, with the possibility of 3 other admins who have more rudimentary permissions. 

## Functional Requirements
Based off user requirements and the project background I won't fill this in since it's mainly assumed how the system will function and it is likely to evolve as I delve into it. 

## Non-functional Requirements
  
### Include conditions or constrains around
– Performance – Fast times but doesn't need to be hyper fast.   
– Capacity – assuming mosque offers maktab classes thats 10 classes with capacity of 30 students = 300, plus an extra 50 for alim and an extra 50 for diploma in islamic studies - both with 3 classes of 15/15/20.   
– Availability - 24/7 access.   
– Portability and interoperability - Mobile app, desktop app, web app.   
– Maintainability - Will maintain and extend features as time goes on   
– Security and privacy - Extended on in future documentation looking at legal and ethical
