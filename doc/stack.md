## Environment Related Tools
I will be using IntelliJ IDEA for java development, ___ for VUE and ____ for Kotlin
## Frontend Technologies
On the frontend for my website I will be using Vue.js for my website, this is because it has a narrower learning curve so for a backend oriented project it'll be quick and easier to learn. In addition, since my website won't have as much functionality beyond basic CRUD it'd be better to prioritise Angular for a future project where I'm not making a website, mobile and desktop app.   
For the frontend of the desktop app I will likely use JavaFX to create a simple yet intuitive UI so the admin/headteacher can easily interact with the data without needing to directly access the database.    
For mobile, I will create a separate UI for android/iOS by using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. 
## Backend Technologies
My main backend will be hosted via SpringBoot and will have shared logic that'll be used for mobile/desktop/browser.  
## Database Tools
Since I'm using MariaDB I will start off by hosting it locally, then gear it towards being deployed online using Docker/a VPS when I can spend more time learning DevOps. 
## Testing Tools
I will test API endpoints on SpringBoot by designing tables with sample inputs, expected outputs and achieved outputs. 
## Deployment Tools
I will probably be using Vercel/GitHub Pages for the website, doubt I'll formally deploy the mobile side and I haven't explored desktop yet so TBC.
## Other Tools
???
