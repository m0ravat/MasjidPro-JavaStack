# Initial Planning 

## Motivation and reason

I wanted to create a unique idea for a product in dire need, and as such have chosen to 
design software for mosques. From personal experience many mosques don't have modern websites
let alone software to enhance the learning experience so my intention is to create a primitive 
idea of how equivalent systems will operate. 

## Basic layout for project
I have actually started this project before as seen it the git commit history, but I took an 
indefinite break in between to prepare for grad applications. As such I want to place more thought
instead of rushing the project to prioritise industry standard practices.    
Based off Santander's project management course I learnt about design thinking which I will go over
in this section.    
I will also be simulating an industry standard team structure by simulating the 
appropriate responses for a product manager, scrum master and regular 
engineers which may include creating multiple accounts or meaningful notes.

## Timeline 
Since I already have the foundations of fullstack development in place this project has no rush, 
I will make appropriate deadlines on Jira.    
Currently, it is 25th September so my only deadline as of
now is to overhaul my current project structure by the end of the month and to revamp documentation.  
My database is currently operational with a connection to my backend. Since I'm trying to prioritise 
extracurricular activites like Leetcode I will work on this project on Tuesdays-Thursday so my prospective deadline dates are factoring this in:   

- Backend endpoints for data should be handled over October, this involves creating the appropriate models, controllers and middleware to authenticate data structure like dates. 
- Backend authentication should be handled in no more than 2 weeks, ideally in succession of the previous bullet point. 
- My website frontend in Vue.js should be created in 3 weeks, 1 week for the generic site, 1 week for the user specific sites and another week factoring in testing and trying to handle test data. 
- My desktop app in SwingUI or JavaFX (haven't decided) should take 2 weeks to design, factoring in time to learn. 
- My Kotlin app is being put on hold, since my aim is to create an MVP a responsive website will work for now but this may be included if further maintained. 
- A week to integrate my backend to frontend so the website queries my database, and another week for the desktop app. 

To conclude, my initial estimated completion should be done by February where I spend 3 days a week working on this. This would be
