# Scrum Analysis/Plan

## Sprints
Each sprint will have a duration of 1 week to a month given the scope of the project. An entire system
may not be designed in a sprint, an example being one sprint for the backend authentication and another sprint for the 
GraphQL based API. This is because they'll be queried by different parts of the website so getting them done at once isn't necessary. The sprints will be as followed:   
- Sprint 1: Backend API (4 weeks)
- Sprint 2: Backend Authentication (2 weeks)
- Sprint 3: Website (3 weeks)
- Spring 4: Desktop App (2 weeks)

Note: These dates are prospective as of 25/09/2025 and may see changes due 
to personal circumstances like preparing for job applications and potential 
holidays where I may be unavailable. This will be noted in my Scrum notes via ___. 

## Team Roles and how they will be implemented

- Client: Since this is a learning project and not commercial ChatGPT will act as my client. 
- Stakeholders: Since many mosques have low budgets it's unrealistic to include investors, so 
the only stakeholder will be the client aka ChatGPT. 
- Developers 1-3: I will simulate two developers tasked with the backend, 1 developing the API, 1 developing the authentication and a third who tests amd approves PR requests.
- Database Administrator: I will simulate a database admin who will manage the MySQL instance on Google Cloud Platform. While it has already been designed and created, requirements may change so the structure of the system's data likely will as well.
- Developer 4: I will simulate another developer tasked with creating the desktop app.
- Developer 5: I will simulate a web developer for the Vue.JS element. 
- Prospective Developer 6: Mobile app developer for Kotlin if implemented in the future.
- Product Owner: I will simulate a product owner by interacting with the client (ChatGPT) and managing the Jira page with backlog items. 
- Scrum Master: Simulated by me again, I will manage the structure of each sprint and decide what backlog items to implement to the definition of Done. 



## Functional Product and MVP
Typically in Scrum the goal of each sprint is to generate a functional product, with the short 
term goal of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Since I'm working on my own the goal of each sprint 
will be to create a modular solution which will be integrated together at the end. It 
should be tested by the end of each sprint and give adequate results but would not generally
be considered marketable.

## Product Market Fit
"The product-market fit concept refers to the alignment between the characteristics and 
functionalities of a product and the needs of the user or customer who is going to pay for it, 
since, if a product does not satisfy anyone's needs, it would fail in the market.

It is that match between the market and the product where it satisfies a real demand, solving 
problems or fulfilling consumers' desires effectively and therefore ensures its success, 
sale, and profit generation."

Since this is a learning project I will consult with ChatGPT regularly as a product manager which will be 
documented somewhere, this will be done to try to mimic this as much as possible. However, since this isn't 
a commercial product as of yet this isn't very relevant but still notable as part of the Scrum framework.

## Sprints
Each sprint will emulate a mini project for each system, with the backend split into 2. This 
is to make sure sprints don't drag on.   

While in typical agile environments each sprint is done in succession this isn't a typical agile 
team. Since my workdays on this project will be Tuesday-Thursday I will spend a week 
in between each sprint to simulate the Sprint planning, review and retrospective - each one 
assigned a day to ensure corners are not cut.   

In addition, personal circumstances may cause delays so I will document artificial pauses when 
necessary. The daily scrum will be done at the start of the days I work and documented appropriately.
