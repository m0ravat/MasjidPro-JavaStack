## Introduction

This project is geared towards implementing a complete solution for a mosque system that extends from student enrollment to graduation, while optimising the experience for teachers, students and parents. It will feature a desktop app for an admin user (mosque IT staff/headteacher), a mobile app for internal teachers/students and a website that will feature a mix of both alongside student enrollment. 

### Project Background
The inspiration of this project is that I wanted to create a worthwhile project that's personal to me. Since many mosques often don't maintain their own websites I assume that there would be a need for that and a way of streamlining student enrollment. Afterwards I figured implementing a learning solution for students/teachers would also help in giving me a project with a scope neither too simple nor impossible. I will be using [Imam Zakariya Academy](https://www.iza.org.uk/) as a baseline since it has an informative website that highlights the scope of a typical mosque's learning experience as well as student/teacher/parent portals. 

### How to run project

Normally I'd design projects with the intent of being deployed locally but seeing the commercial nature alongside it extending upon every tech medium (browser, desktop & mobile) it would be extremely tedious. I will deploy the website online for visual use with a simulated user available alongside an installation for said desktop app, however at this stage I am unsure if I'll be able to put a relevant mobile version on the app store. I will provide screenshots/videos of how the system operates at later stages.
